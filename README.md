# BlackBox Flight Recorder

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress!

Welcome to the BlackBox Flight Recorder, a personal flight tracker for flight simulators.
It is inspired by other apps, such as Volanta, but is much lighter on resources and allows
you to more readily access your own data.

### Features
* BlackBox currently only works with X-Plane 12 via a plugin.
* BlackBox stores everything locally in an SQLite database and not other people's servers.
* There is a Qt-based UI that doesn't have to be running to keep tracking.

### To Do
In rough order of priority:
* Configuration
* Build releasable artifacts
* Pass judgement on your landings, much like [Stable Approach](https://github.com/Clamb94/StableApproach) but is Open Source.
* Track screenshots
* Import SimBrief details
* Fancier UI features
* Some way of sharing your flights
* Porting to other simulators?


## For Flight Simulation Only!
I don't know why you'd try to shoe-horn this in to a real cockpit, but please don't
try. And if you do, don't blame me if it all goes wrong.
